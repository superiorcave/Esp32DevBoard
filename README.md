# Esp32DevBoard
An custom esp32 wroom devboard.

I used a custom ESP32-S3-Wroom-1 to create this project. This has all of the capabilities of a normal esp32, but with a custom pcb, 3 LEDS, and a cyberpunk logo.

To Order the PCB you need to click on production and download "Devboardv2.zip" and upload that as the gerber file.
When ordering the part of JLCPCB, select PCB Assembly and make sure that part selection is by JLCPCB.
